# Hungry Monster!

This is a simple math game that I created for my 7 year old niece to practice Javascript and module patterning. It is for mobile devices, thus touch (not click) and drag.  

Play at [HungryMonster.fun](http://hungrymonster.fun/)  
Remember to open up Chrome DevTools to use the mobile simulator.
